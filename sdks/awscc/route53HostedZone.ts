     * operations automatically. Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you
     * create a query logging configuration. Note the following: You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region. You
     * must use the same to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for. When you
     * create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example: /aws/route53/hosted
     * zone name In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the
     * associated resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that you can
     * create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups
     * that you create for query logging. Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53
     * needs to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. You must create the CloudWatch Logs resource policy
     * in the us-east-1 region. For the value of Resource, specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous
     * step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging
     * configurations, replace the hosted zone name with *, for example:
     * arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/* To avoid the confused deputy problem, a security issue
     * where an entity without a permission for an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform it, you can optionally
     * limit the permissions that a service has to a resource in a resource-based policy by supplying the following values: For
     * aws:SourceArn, supply the hosted zone ARN used in creating the query logging configuration. For example, aws:SourceArn:
     * arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted zone ID. For aws:SourceAccount, supply the account ID for the account that creates
     * the query logging configuration. For example, aws:SourceAccount:111111111111. For more information, see The confused
     * deputy problem in the IAM User Guide. You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must
     * use the CloudWatch API, one of the SDKs, or the . + Log Streams and Edge Locations When Route 53 finishes creating the
     * configuration for DNS query logging, it does the following: Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time
     * that the edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries
     * that Route 53 responds to for that edge location. Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream. The name of
     * each log stream is in the following format: hosted zone ID/edge location code The edge location code is a three-letter
     * code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the
     * International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might
     * change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the Route 53 Product Details
     * page. + Queries That Are Logged Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route 53. If a DNS
     * resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the
     * resolver will continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the
     * corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set,
     * and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query out of
     * every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS. For more information about how DNS works, see Routing Internet
     * Traffic to Your Website or Web Application in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. + Log File Format For a list of the
