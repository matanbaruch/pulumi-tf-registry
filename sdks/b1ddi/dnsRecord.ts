     * Subfield | Description | Required ------------|-------------------------------------|--------- flags | A character
     * string containing flags to control aspects of the rewriting and interpretation of the fields in the DNS resource record.
     * The flags that are currently used are: <ul><li> __U__: Indicates that the output maps to a URI (Uniform Record
     * Identifier). </li><li> __S__: Indicates that the output is a domain name that has at least one SRV record. The DNS
     * client must then send a query for the SRV record of the resulting domain name. </li><li> __A__: Indicates that the

     * record of the resulting domain name. </li><li> __P__: Indicates that the protocol specified in the _services_ field
     * defines the next step or phase. </li></ul> | No order | A 16-bit unsigned integer specifying the order in which the

     * the "flags" field. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. <br><br> | Yes preference |A 16-bit unsigned integer that
     * specifies the order in which NAPTR records with equal "order" values should be processed, low numbers being processed
     * before high numbers. This is similar to the preference field in an MX record, and is used so domain administrators can
     * direct clients towards more capable hosts or lighter weight protocols. A client may look at records with higher
     * preference values if it has a good reason to do so such as not understanding the preferred protocol or service. The
     * range of the value is 0 to 65535.<br><br> | Yes regexp | A string containing a substitution expression that is applied

     * _flags_ field. This can be an absolute or relative domain name. Can be empty.<br><br> | Yes services | Specifies the
     * service(s) available down this rewrite path. It may also specify the particular protocol that is used to talk with a
     * service. A protocol must be specified if the flags field states that the NAPTR is terminal. If a protocol is specified,
     * but the flags field does not state that the NAPTR is terminal, the next lookup must be for a NAPTR. The client may
     * choose not to perform the next lookup if the protocol is unknown, but that behavior must not be relied upon.<br><br>The
     * service field may take any of the values below (using the Augmented BNF of RFC 2234):<br><br>service_field = [
     * [protocol] *("+" rs)]<br>protocol = ALPHA * 31 ALPHANUM<br>rs = ALPHA * 31 ALPHANUM<br><br>The protocol and rs fields
     * are limited to 32 characters and must start with an alphabetic character.<br><br> For example, an optional protocol
     * specification followed by 0 or more resolution services. Each resolution service is indicated by an initial '+'
     * character.<br><br> Note that the empty string is also a valid service field. This will typically be seen at the
     * beginning of a series of rules, when it is impossible to know what services and protocols will be offered by a
     * particular service.<br><br> The actual format of the service request and response will be determined by the resolution
     * protocol. Protocols need not offer all services. The labels for service requests shall be formed from the set of
     * characters [A-Z0-9]. The case of the alphabetic characters is not significant.<br><br> | Yes Subfields for _NS_ (Name
     * Server) record: Subfield | Description | Required ---------|-------------------------------------|--------- dname | A
     * domain-name which specifies a host which should be authoritative for the specified class and domain. Can be absolute or
     * relative domain name and include UTF-8. <br><br> | Yes Subfields for _PTR_ (Pointer) record: Subfield | Description |
     * Required ---------|-------------------------------------|--------- dname | A domain name which points to some location
     * in the domain name space. Can be absolute or relative domain name and include UTF-8. <br><br> | Yes Subfields for _SOA_
     * (Start of Authority) record: Subfield | Description | Required ------------
     * |-------------------------------------|--------- expire | The time interval in seconds after which zone data will expire
     * and secondary server stops answering requests for the zone.<br><br> | No mname | The domain name for the master server
     * for the zone. Can be absolute or relative domain name.<br><br> | Yes negative_ttl | The time interval in seconds for
     * which name servers can cache negative responses for zone. <br><br>Defaults to 900 seconds (15 minutes).<br><br> | No
     * refresh | The time interval in seconds that specifies how often secondary servers need to send a message to the primary
     * server for a zone to check that their data is current, and retrieve fresh data if it is not.<br><br>Defaults to 10800
     * seconds (3 hours).<br><br> | No retry | The time interval in seconds for which the secondary server will wait before
     * attempting to recontact the primary server after a connection failure occurs.<br><br>Defaults to 3600 seconds (1
     * hour).<br><br> | No rname | The domain name which specifies the mailbox of the person responsible for this zone.
     * <br><br> | No serial | An unsigned 32-bit integer that specifies the serial number of the zone. Used to indicate that
     * zone data was updated, so the secondary name server can initiate zone transfer. The range of the value is 0 to
     * 4294967295. <br><br> | No Subfields for _SRV_ (Service) record: Subfield | Description | Required
     * ---------|-------------------------------------|--------- port | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies the port on
     * this target host of this service. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. This is often as specified in Assigned Numbers
     * but need not be.<br><br> | Yes priority | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies the priority of this target host.
     * The range of the value is 0 to 65535. A client must attempt to contact the target host with the lowest-numbered priority
     * it can reach. Target hosts with the same priority should be tried in an order defined by the _weight_ field.<br><br>|
     * Yes target | The domain name of the target host. There must be one or more address records for this name, the name must
     * not be an alias (in the sense of RFC 1034 or RFC 2181).<br><br>A target of "." means that the service is decidedly not
     * available at this domain. | Yes weight | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies a relative weight for entries with
     * the same priority. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. Larger weights should be given a proportionately higher
     * probability of being selected. Domain administrators should use weight 0 when there isn't any server selection to do, to
     * make the RR easier to read for humans (less noisy). In the presence of records containing weights greater than 0,
     * records with weight 0 should have a very small chance of being selected.<br><br>In the absence of a protocol whose
     * specification calls for the use of other weighting information, a client arranges the SRV RRs of the same priority in
     * the order in which target hosts, specified by the SRV RRs, will be contacted.<br><br>Defaults to 0.<br><br>| No
     * Subfields for _TXT_ (Text) record: Subfield | Description | Required
     * ---------|-------------------------------------|--------- text | The semantics of the text depends on the domain where
     * it is found.<br><br> | No Generic record can be used to represent any DNS resource record not listed above. Subfields
     * for a generic record consist of a list of struct subfields, each having the following sub-subfields: Sub-subfield |
     * Description | Required -------------|------------------------------------|--------- type | Following types are

     * Unsigned 32-bit integer. </li><li> _IPV6_: IPv6 address. For example, "abcd:123::abcd". </li><li> _IPV4_: IPv4 address.
     * For example, "1.1.1.1". </li><li> _DomainName_: Domain name (absolute or relative). </li><li> _TEXT_: ASCII text.
     * </li><li> _BASE64_: Base64 encoded binary data. </li><li> _HEX_: Hex encoded binary data. </li><li>_PRESENTATION_:
     * Presentation is a standard textual form of record data, as shown in a standard master zone file. <br><br> For example,
     * an IPSEC RDATA could be specified using the PRESENTATION type field whose value is "10 1 2 192.0.2.38
     * AQNRU3mG7TVTO2BkR47usntb102uFJtugbo6BSGvgqt4AQ==", instead of a sequence of the following subfields: <ul><li> 8BIT:

     * Server) record: Subfield | Description | Required ---------|-------------------------------------|--------- dname | A
     * domain-name which specifies a host which should be authoritative for the specified class and domain. Can be absolute or
     * relative domain name and include UTF-8. <br><br> | Yes Subfields for _PTR_ (Pointer) record: Subfield | Description |
     * Required ---------|-------------------------------------|--------- dname | A domain name which points to some location

     * (Start of Authority) record: Subfield | Description | Required ------------
     * |-------------------------------------|--------- expire | The time interval in seconds after which zone data will expire
     * and secondary server stops answering requests for the zone.<br><br> | No mname | The domain name for the master server
     * for the zone. Can be absolute or relative domain name.<br><br> | Yes negative_ttl | The time interval in seconds for
     * which name servers can cache negative responses for zone. <br><br>Defaults to 900 seconds (15 minutes).<br><br> | No
     * refresh | The time interval in seconds that specifies how often secondary servers need to send a message to the primary
     * server for a zone to check that their data is current, and retrieve fresh data if it is not.<br><br>Defaults to 10800
     * seconds (3 hours).<br><br> | No retry | The time interval in seconds for which the secondary server will wait before
     * attempting to recontact the primary server after a connection failure occurs.<br><br>Defaults to 3600 seconds (1
     * hour).<br><br> | No rname | The domain name which specifies the mailbox of the person responsible for this zone.
     * <br><br> | No serial | An unsigned 32-bit integer that specifies the serial number of the zone. Used to indicate that
     * zone data was updated, so the secondary name server can initiate zone transfer. The range of the value is 0 to
     * 4294967295. <br><br> | No Subfields for _SRV_ (Service) record: Subfield | Description | Required
     * ---------|-------------------------------------|--------- port | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies the port on
     * this target host of this service. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. This is often as specified in Assigned Numbers
     * but need not be.<br><br> | Yes priority | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies the priority of this target host.
     * The range of the value is 0 to 65535. A client must attempt to contact the target host with the lowest-numbered priority
     * it can reach. Target hosts with the same priority should be tried in an order defined by the _weight_ field.<br><br>|
     * Yes target | The domain name of the target host. There must be one or more address records for this name, the name must
     * not be an alias (in the sense of RFC 1034 or RFC 2181).<br><br>A target of "." means that the service is decidedly not
     * available at this domain. | Yes weight | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies a relative weight for entries with
     * the same priority. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. Larger weights should be given a proportionately higher
     * probability of being selected. Domain administrators should use weight 0 when there isn't any server selection to do, to
     * make the RR easier to read for humans (less noisy). In the presence of records containing weights greater than 0,
     * records with weight 0 should have a very small chance of being selected.<br><br>In the absence of a protocol whose
     * specification calls for the use of other weighting information, a client arranges the SRV RRs of the same priority in
     * the order in which target hosts, specified by the SRV RRs, will be contacted.<br><br>Defaults to 0.<br><br>| No
